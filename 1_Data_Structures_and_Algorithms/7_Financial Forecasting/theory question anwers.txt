1. Understand Recursive Algorithms:

--Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. The process continues until a base case is reached, which stops the recursion.
Recursion is particularly useful for breaking down complex problems into manageable subproblems. Some common examples where recursion is applied include:
i. Calculating the Fibonacci series
ii. Finding the factorial of a number
iii. Performing financial forecasting 

4.Analysis:

-- Assuming the recursive algorithm runs for n steps:

Recursive depth = Number of Recursive calls = n

Each recursive call performs a constant time operation 
Therefore,
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n) 

-- We can optimize it using:

I. Memoization: It stores the results of previous computations to avoid redundant calculations thus improving performance in overlapping subproblems.

II. Using Loops: For simple cases we can use loops instead of recursion.
